<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Chocolate Chip Cookies: when you find a good one, it’s the unicorn of dessert<br>
recipes. There are so many recipes out there and I’m not gonna lie: most of them<br>
are meh.</p>

<p>Some of them are okay.</p>

<p>Some of them are not very good at all.</p>

<p>Some of them a great…but not OMG!</p>

<p>And the rest are just…meh.</p>

<p>THIS chocolate chip cookie recipe is the only one (of two) that you need. It’s soft<br>
and chewy, full of chocolate, with depth of flavor. They’re easy to make with no<br>
weird ingredients and you can change up the recipe to make any kind of cookie<br>
recipe you want.</p>

<p>I know, I know. I already have a BOMB-DIGGITTY chocolate chip cookie recipe. I<br>
do. It’s a copycat of that Doubletree recipe everyone loves and believe me, that<br>
recipe is TOP NOTCH. But it’s not a…regular chocolate chip cookie.</p>

<p>HUH?</p>

<p>I put cookie recipes in three camps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Specialty and Holiday (like cutout sugar cookies or blueberry pie cookies)</li>
    <li>Unique or Single-Use Dough (aka BOM DOT COM) cookies (like the doubletree<br>
    chocolate chip copycat or peanut butter snickerdoodles)</li>
    <li>Basic recipes that aren’t at all basic; these are the blueprint for a million other<br>
    recipes.</li>
</ol>
<p>
These chocolate chip cookies are #3: they’re just a basic recipe. And that’s okay,<br>
because basic recipes taste amazing (ahem: soft AND chewy sugar cookies) but<br>
they can also be turned into SO MANY other recipes.
</p>

<p>
For years I’ve been making a version of this cookie recipe. I’ve changed it here<br>
and there, to make Kit Kat Cookies or Chocolate Chip Cookie Gooey Bars. I’ve<br>
added Reese’s Pieces to them and stuffed them with peanut butter cups.
</p>

<p>
I finally decided I needed to sit down and formalize my favorite (and most<br>
versatile) chocolate chip cookie recipe and post it for you. And this is it

<p>The BEST Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe is easy to make and a great base for so many other cookie recipes!</p>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<ul>
 <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
 <li>1/3 cup (66 g) granulated sugar</li>
 <li>1/2 cup (104g) packed light brown sugar</li>
 <li>1 large egg</li>
 <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract</li>
 <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
 <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
 <li>1 1/2 cups (186g) all-purpose flour</li>
 <li>1 1/2 cups (255g) chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk)</li>
</ul>
 
<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Note: This dough requires chilling.</li><br>
    
    <li>Place melted butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle<br>
    attachment (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer). Add granulated and<br>
    brown sugars and mix on low speed until the mixture is smooth. Mix in egg<br>
    and vanilla extract and mix on medium speed until combined.</li><br>

    <li>Mix in baking soda and salt, then slowly mix in flour and mix just until the<br>
        batter is smooth and comes together. Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl<br>
        during mixing. Slowly mix in chocolate chips.</li><br>
    
    <li>Line a cookie sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Scoop 2<br>
        tablespoon balls of dough onto the cookie sheet. Spacing doesn’t matter<br>
        because you will be chilling the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at<br>
        least 2 hours.</li><br>

    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a second cookie sheet with parchment paper or<br>
        a silicone baking mat.</li><br>

    <li>Remove the chilled cookie dough balls from the refrigerator and space them<br>
    2-inches apart on the cookie sheets. Bake (2 tablespoon sized cookies) for<br>
    11-15 minutes, or until the edges are a light golden and the tops are no<br>
    longer glossy. Let cool on the cookie sheets at least 10 minutes before<br>
    removing.</li><br>
