        <h1>Sundial</h1>

        <p><b>A sundial measures time by the position of the sun.</b> The most commonly seen designs, such as<br>
        the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours of<br>
        the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow changes. However,<br>
        sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <p>Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time. Minor design variations can measure standard<br>
        and daylight saving time, as well.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <div>
        <p>Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC) are <b>known from ancient<br>
        Egypt</b>, and were developed further by other cultures, including the Chinese, Greek, and Roman<br>
        cultures. A type of sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old Testament (Isaiah 38:2).<br></p>

        <div>
        <p>The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160 BC-ca. 100 BC) is said to have<br>
        invented a universal sundial that could be used anywhere on Earth. The French astronomer Oronce<br>
        Fine constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a<br> 
        treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out<br>
        of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani's Construction instrumenti ad horologia<br>
        solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying illustrations.</p>

        <h2>Installation of standard sundials</h2>
        <div>
        <p>Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. By tilting such a sundial, it<br>
        may be installed so that it will keep time. However, some mass-produced garden sundials are<br> 
        inaccurate because of poor design and cannot be corrected.</p>
